Tuy nhiên với dây chuyền sản xuất có nhiều loại hóa chất tăng vị ngon, mùi hương là một mối họa tiềm ẩn lâu dài ít ai biết. Sau đây là cách phân biệt nước mắm truyền thống và nước mắm công nghiệp:

### ✨Dựa vào thành phần

- Nước mắm truyền thống: Nguyên liệu chủ yếu cá và muối với tỉ lệ 3 cá 1 muối hoặc 10 cá 4 muối.
- Nước mắm công nghiệp: Có khoảng 20 thành phần khác nhau

### ✨Dựa vào độ đạm

Theo nghiên cứu của các chuyên gia Việt Nam đã phân chia theo độ đạm của nước mắm chính gốc gồm có 4 loại như sau:

- Nước mắm loại đặc biệt: độ đạm > 30 độ
- Nước mắm loại thượng hạng: độ đạm > 25 độ
- Nước mắm loại hạng 1: độ đạm > 15 độ
- Nước mắm loại hạng 2: độ đạm > 10 độ

Nước mắm truyền thống: làm từ cá và muối biển, giàu dinh dưỡng, có độ đạm cao dao động từ 25-40 độ

Nước mắm công nghiệp: được tạo thành từ sự pha loãng nước mắm truyền thống, sau đó trộn thêm hơn chục chất điều vị, tạo màu, chất bảo quản, chất điều chỉnh độ chua, tạo sánh...có những loại chỉ được gọi là nước chấm vì độ đạm thậm chí còn < 10 độ

### ✨Dựa vào màu sắc

Nước mắm truyền thống: Có màu vàng ươm nếu đã mở nắp và tiếp xúc với không khí vài tiếng sẽ chuyển sang màu sẫm hơn do trong quá trình chế biến không sử dụng chất phụ gia

Nước mắm công nghiệp: có màu sắc đẹp mắt, và để ngoài không khí bên ngoài vẫn không thay đổi màu sắc do có sử dụng chất tạo màu và chất phụ gia.

### ✨Dựa vào hương vị

Nước mắm truyền thống: Vị mặn, gắt nhưng ăn thấy có vị ngọt của đạm thật ở đầu lưỡi. Hương vị thơm nồng, có màu trong veo, hơi đậm.

Nước mắm công nghiệp: Vị ngọt dịu, dễ ăn, màu sắc trong, hơi nhạt.

**👉Và cách dễ phân biệt nhất là về giá thành, nước mắm truyền thống có giá cao hơn từ 60.000đ đến 80.000/chai. Có loại cao cấp trên 100.000đ so với nước mắm công nghiệp.**

<!--## Crafting the Perfect Landing Page

Every element of your Landing Page should resonate with its core objective. Here's what a high-converting Landing Page entails:

- **Benefit-Centric Headline**: Your headline should instantly convey the value proposition.
- **Engaging Imagery**: Visuals that complement and enhance the content.
- **Compelling Copy**: Clear, concise, and persuasive text that speaks directly to the visitor's needs.
- **Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)**: A standout button or link urging the visitor to take action.
- **Minimalist Design**: A clutter-free layout that emphasizes the offer. For example, using a Tailwind CSS web template like AstroWind.
- **Trust Indicators**: Endorsements, reviews, and badges that bolster credibility.

Imagine browsing online for a writing course. You land on a page with a captivating headline: "Unlock the Writer Within." Below, there's an engaging image of a person writing, followed by persuasive text and a bright "Enroll Now" button. This Landing Page has effectively used its elements to entice you to sign up.

## Homepage vs. Landing Page

While both are pivotal, they serve distinct roles:

- **Homepage**: Offers a panoramic view of your brand, catering to diverse visitor intents.
- **Landing Page**: Zeros in on a single, specific action, be it signing up, purchasing, or downloading.

Consider a popular online store. Their homepage might display various product categories, from electronics to clothing. However, if they’re promoting a summer sale, the Landing Page would focus solely on summer products. This focused approach urges visitors to take action, encouraging them to "Shop the Summer Sale Now!"

## The Art of Optimization

The digital realm is ever-evolving. Regular tweaks based on analytics can ensure your Landing Page remains a conversion powerhouse. Embrace A/B testing to compare different versions and refine for optimal results.

Let's say you have a Landing Page for a new skincare product. Version A uses an image of the product, while Version B showcases a video review. A/B testing might reveal that Version B, with the video, has a 20% higher conversion rate. Such insights can be invaluable for future campaigns.

## Landing Pages in Action

Landing Pages are versatile tools in your marketing toolkit. They play a role in various scenarios: promoting a product launch, capturing emails for a newsletter, or driving event registrations. They’re not just about capturing leads but nurturing and converting them.

Presented below are several prevalent types of Landing Pages. Each link offers a prime example of its respective type. Additionally, we carefully craft each link in the form of a comprehensive guide.

This approach ensures that you observe the best practices in action. Also, it enables you to acquire a step-by-step understanding of how to skillfully create each type.

**Content**: Extensive, providing a wealth of information including product details, benefits, user stories, success stories, guarantees, and bonuses.

**Focus**: Utilizes a narrative to present a problem and offer the product or service as the solution. The aim is to emotionally connect with the visitor.
